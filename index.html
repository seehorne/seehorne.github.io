                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    I am an incoming PhD student (starting fall 2025) at <a href="https://cse.engin.umich.edu/" target="_blank">UMich CSE</a> advised by <a href="https://guoanhong.com/" target="_blank">Anhong Guo</a> and

                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to joining Michigan for my PhD, I was supported by <a href= "https://cra.org/cra-wp/dreu-2-2/" target="_blank">CRA DREU</a> 
                    to join <a href="https://guoanhong.com/" target="_blank">Human-AI Lab (HAIL)</a> here as a summer research intern.
                    I have also previously done research at the University of Washington Allen School as part of the 
                    <a href="https://make4all.org/" target="_blank">Make4All lab</a> through the <a href= "https://dub.washington.edu/reu.html" target="_blank">DUB REU</a> 
                    and at the Carnegie Mellon Human Computer Interaction Institute as part of the <a href="https://haiyizhu.com/" target="_blank">Social AI Group</a> 
                    and the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./aleven/" target="_blank">CATS Lab</a> through the <a href="https://hcii.cmu.edu/summer-research-program" target="_blank">HCII REU</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In May 2025, I earned my Bachelor's degree from <a href="https://www.grinnell.edu/" target="_blank">Grinnell College</a>
                    with majors in Computer Science (w/ honors) and Sociology (w/ honors) and a concentration in Statistics.

                <p>
                    My current research focuses on AI approaches for personal accessibility, that is:
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:center;">
                    <strong><em>How might personal devices
                    such as smart phones and wearables be used in conjunction with AI systems to facilitate individualized accessibility 
                    experiences that empower agency and autonomy?</em></strong> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this, I am particularly drawn to user-centric, participatory methods such as iterative co-design.

            <!-- <h2>Service</h2>
                <p>
                    Most of my service work has been rooted in the Temple HCI Lab, where I took on a leadership role
                    mentoring newer students, facilitating reading groups, and organizing collaborative workshops. I
                    helped structure onboarding processes, provided feedback on projects, and worked closely with
                    faculty to ensure that students felt supported and engaged. An important aspect was creating an
                    environment where everyone
                    could contribute meaningfully—regardless of prior experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside the lab, I served as President of Temple’s ACM chapter. I worked with a small team to host
                    employer visits, technical workshops, student socials, and
                    events designed to bring the department together. I wanted ACM to feel like a space where students
                    could grow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also directed OwlHacks, Temple’s annual hackathon, reviving the event after a two-year hiatus. We
                    organized two hackathons in under a year, growing participation by over 100 students and ending with
                    the largest hackathon in Temple’s history, with more than 250 attendees. I focused on building a
                    beginner-friendly experience that encouraged collaboration and learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve also mentored undergraduate researchers through the NSF REU program. My focus there was on
                    building a near-peer mentorship model where students felt comfortable asking questions and learning
                    research practices. I aimed to reduce the power distance between faculty and students by fostering a
                    supportive and conversational research environment.
